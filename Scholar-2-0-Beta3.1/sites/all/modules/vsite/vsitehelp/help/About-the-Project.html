      <p>The Scholars' Web Sites Project represents a paradigm shift in how the personal web sites of academic scholars are created and maintained. Our web application creates dynamic and customizable faculty web sites in a matter of seconds. Each web site comes with a suite of&nbsp; powerful tools users can choose from that facilitate creating,distributing, and preserving knowledge faster and more efficiently than ever before.</p> <p>For example, scholarly papers you upload to your site appear there, are automatically distributed to public indices (RePec, PubMed, Google scholar, SSI, polmeth, SSRN, etc.), and are posted on other relevant Harvard sites (such as IQSS, your academic department, and the Office of Scholarly Communication); your papers, or their citation information, and can then be downloaded by others in multiple formats or subscribed to via RSS feeds.  You can use your site to organize your work, publish news and announcements, post presentations, and class materials, aggregate and post RSS feeds from other sites, and maintain contact with students, colleagues and collaborators.  With a click you can add many features, such as a secure facility to share private files, messages, todo lists, calendars, data, and documentation with collaborators prior to public distribution; establish a dataverse to distribute data or your view of the universe of data; create your own blog; or add many wigets such as automatic translation, search, and notification.</p> <p>Users have total (password-protected) control over the look, feel, and content of their site through an easy WYSIWYG interface.</p>    </div>
