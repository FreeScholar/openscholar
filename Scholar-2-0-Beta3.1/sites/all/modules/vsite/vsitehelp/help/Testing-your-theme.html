      <p>To test your theme's CSS we have a themer kit which can be downloaded. The kit contains a dummy index.html file with the Scholar Web Sites Project base theme, all in a directory called scholar_theme_kit. The dummy index.html file also has a link to a blank css file called my-theme.css. This is where you should work. Add background images to the supplied images directory.</p>    </div>
