      <p>You can completely customize the menus for your site. There are two areas for menus â€“ a "primary menu" and a "secondary menu". Often the secondary menu might be in one of the left or right columns and would be links to perhaps second-level material. Primary links are often first-level material and might typically be found in the navigation bar area. However you can experiment with links in either menus and place them wherever you like.</p><p>One caveat is that themes may presume a maximum <em>number of menu items</em> in the navigation bar area. If you exceed that number the site may look funny. That said, you're welcome to present your content in any way you prefer.</p><p>The <strong>Menu</strong> section of the Control Panel (under<strong> Settings</strong>) allows you to choose which links should go in which menu. You are presented with a table with Menu Items to the left and a series of radio buttons to choose whether each menu item should be in the primary menu, the secondary menu, or off.</p><p>if you create custom menu links (see "Creating custom menu links") they will also show here. Some columns may be greyed out which means that the feature responsible for this menu item is not enabled. Features can be enabled under the "Features" tab in settings.</p><p>The horizontal list across the top lists the avalible menus as well as "none" which will hide that link.&nbsp; Additionally there is a column called "delete", this allows you to remove custom menu entries from the list.&nbsp; If an entire column for a menu is greyed out then the menu has not been put into the site layout.&nbsp; You can drag the menu into the site layout on the "Layout" tab under "Settings".</p>    </div>
