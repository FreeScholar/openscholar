      <p><strong>Site Information</strong> (under <strong>Settings</strong>) provides access to change your basic site information 
      such as name, professional title and address, global taxonomy terms, and site logo. </p>
      
      <p>The <strong>"Main Headline"</strong> field is normally reserved for your name.<br />
      The <strong>"Sub Headline"</strong> is normally for your professional title, but can be whatever you prefer.<br />
      The <strong>"Address Line"</strong> is your office address.</p>
      
      <p>This information will automatically appear in your site's header section. Both "Sub Headline" and "Address line" are optional fields.</p> 
      
      <p>The <strong>"Related Interests:" </strong>vocabulary field provides a space for you to enter a list of taxonomy terms (or tags)  to describe your content. Tagged content allow users 
      to find all content related it a common topic. In the text field, you can create a list of these terms which will be available for all content that you post
      on your site. If you enabled the "Categories"  widget in the Control Panel <strong>Layout</strong> section,  your site's visitors will be able to see a list 
      of these terms which will link to the related content.</p>
      

      <p>Your <strong>Site logo (photo)</strong> can be uploaded and/or cropped. Particular themes may resize the photo depending on the presentation, but the general aspect-ratio is set. To crop a photo to the default shape,&nbsp; grab the cropping tool handles and adjust. You'll see  a preview of the cropped photo to the left of the cropping area. You'll want to make sure the original image you upload is&nbsp;<em>at least&nbsp;</em>the size of the default image (180px by 140px).</p><p><img class="mceItem" src="path:cropper.jpg" alt="" height="471" width="634" /></p>    </div>
