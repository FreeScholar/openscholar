      <p>Custom <strong>themes</strong> for individual scholar sites can be added to individual installations of the project software. Themes consistent of CSS and any custom images, much as one would at the famous <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden site</a>. You do not have access to the markup itself - only the presentation layer. In this way we can provide an elegant and scalable application for all.</p><p>Your custom theme will be a <strong>sub-theme</strong> of out <strong>'base theme'</strong> which will also load. Your CSS will override CSS in the base theme. You can create clean and compact CSS by choosing to keep whichever defaults from the <strong>base theme</strong> you want. We&nbsp;therefore recommend becoming familar with the markup we provide and the default CSS. Much of that can be done in the usual ways (read: Firefox and Firebug..) but here we provide some general background.</p>    </div>
