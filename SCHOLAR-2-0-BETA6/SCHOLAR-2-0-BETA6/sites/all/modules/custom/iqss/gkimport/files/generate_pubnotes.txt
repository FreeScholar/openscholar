The software also easily fits into existing research practices since, after preprocessing data with MatchIt, researchers can use whatever parametric model they would have used without MatchIt, but produce inferences with substantially more robustness and less sensitivity to modeling assumptions.

(A uniform consensus has existed in the academic literature since at least King and Browning (1987) on partisan symmetry as a standard for fairness, and even the U.S. Supreme Court now appears to agree; see Grofman and King (2007).)
