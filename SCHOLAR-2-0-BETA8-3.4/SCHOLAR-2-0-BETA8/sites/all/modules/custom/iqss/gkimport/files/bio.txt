<p>King's work is widely read across scholarly fields and beyond
academia. He was listed as the most cited political scientist of his
cohort; among the group of "political scientists who have made the
most important theoretical contributions" to the discipline "from its
beginnings in the late-19th century to the present"; and on ISI's list
of the most highly cited researchers across the social sciences.  His
work on legislative redistricting has been used in most American
states by legislators, judges, lawyers, political parties, minority
groups, and private citizens, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court. His
work on inferring individual behavior from aggregate data has been
used in as many states by these groups, and in many other practical
contexts.  His contribution to methods for achieving cross-cultural
comparability in survey research have been used in surveys in over
eighty countries by researchers, governments, and private
concerns. King led an evaluation of the Mexican universal health
insurance program, which includes the largest randomized health policy
experiment to date.  The statistical methods and software he developed
are used extensively in academia, government, consulting, and private
industry.</p>
