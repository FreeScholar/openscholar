      <p>The Settings button in the Control Panel has a number of sub-buttons to choose from. One of them is<strong> Themes</strong>. Themes are visual presentations with a particular look and feel and you have the option of choosing any of these, indeed you can change themes at will. A custom theme, available to only you, can be designed and will appear to only you in this area of the Control Panel.</p><p>One thing to note about themes is that while many of them are consistent with where various elements of your site are located – such as your photo, name, address, etc. – some themes may have unusual ways of displaying these elements. It is advised if changing your theme to look carefully throughout your site to deturmine if the placement of all the site elements work for you.</p>    </div>
