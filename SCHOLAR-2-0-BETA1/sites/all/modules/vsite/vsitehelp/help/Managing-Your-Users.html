To add a new user click on the "Add new user" link in red and fill out the form. The individual will be notified that you've requested that they be a site member/user.</p><h3>Admin Privileges</h3><p>You can grant admin privileges for assistants once the user has logged in and has an account. Simply return to the Members admin area and click "Admin: Create" for that person. They can now create content on your site.</p>    </div>
