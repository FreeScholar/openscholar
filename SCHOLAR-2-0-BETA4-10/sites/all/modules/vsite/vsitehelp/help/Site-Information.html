      <p><strong>Site Information</strong> (under <strong>Settings</strong>) provides access to change your basic site information such as name, professional title and address. Technically you could rename your site something besides your name ("Super Professor"?) so the field normally reserved for name is "Main Headline". "Sub Headline" would normally be your professional title but, again, can be whatever you prefer. The "Address Line" follows as well.</p><p>The <strong>"Link to Home Page" </strong>check box, when checked, enables the Main Headline to also become a link to your front page. This is fairly standard for sites these days.</p><p>The <strong>"Add Link to contact form?"</strong> check box enables a link from your address line to a contact form.</p>    </div>
