      <p>You can of course do anything you want with the CSS of your custom theme, but it's not a bad idea to know how the <strong>base theme</strong> on which you'll be essentially overrriding is constructed. The <strong>base theme</strong>'s CSS is loaded before yours so many <em>default</em> <em>attributes</em> can be used if you prefer.</p><h3>Holy Grail?</h3><p>The basic default layout is based on <a href="path:holy-grail-map.png" alt="" height="495" width="630" /></p><h3>Same for headers, with a caveat</h3><p>The exact same structure and defaults are used for the header regions, however since #header-main is optional there's default CSS to allow for only left and right header areas.</p><table id="attachments" class="sticky-enabled">
