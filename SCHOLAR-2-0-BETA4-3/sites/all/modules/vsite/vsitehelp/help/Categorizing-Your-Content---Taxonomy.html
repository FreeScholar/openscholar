      <p>Content can be categorized both both feature-specific categorizes, or by site-wide categories. Categorizing your content can be quite useful to both you and the users of your site. For instance you may have a blog entry, a review of a new book on Camus, and you may choose to categorize this blog post as "Camus", "absurdism",&nbsp;and "literary crititism". Meanwhile you may also haved posted some class material that focused on literary criticism on a different topic, which you categorize as "literary criticism". Both the class material and your blog post on Camus can now appear together if a user searches your site for "literary criticism" or clicks on the category links that will appear in your posts.</p><h3>Adding Categories</h3><p>You can add new categories by going to the Control Panel, clicking the "Content" menu button and then "Taxonomy", and the "Add category" link</p>    </div>
